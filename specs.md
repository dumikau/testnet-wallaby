### Wallaby Testnet for FVM Developers

A shared FVM developer-focused testnet to support deployment and testing of longer-running smart contracts and storage deals with closer-to-mainnet-like conditions and enable more interactive use cases to be tried out between projects.

**Components:**
- Shared public testnet based on FVM experimental branch that will likely be reset every few weeks[?]
- Public faucet webpage
- Dedicated storage miners auto-accepting deals for 512 MiB, 32 GiB sectors with faster sealing
- Simulate an environment similar to Filecoin mainnet, such as Fil+ registry settings, etc.
- Downloadable snapshots for fast bootstrap (regenerated once a week)
- Block explorer [will ask Filscan.io]
- Hosted RPC endpoints [will ask Glif Nodes]
